# Stock Price Prediction and Zero-Lag MACD Enhancement Using Ensemble Methods

## Overview
This project investigates how ensemble machine learning models using simple averaging can improve the accuracy and generalizability of stock price predictions. These enhanced predictions are then integrated into trading strategies based on the Zero-Lag MACD technical indicator. 
The ultimate goal is to filter trading signals by forecasting one-step-ahead stock prices, enabling more effective buy and sell decisions in real-world trading scenarios.

By combining robust predictive models with technical analysis, this system aims to:
- To propose an ensemble machine learning approach for stock price prediction through the enhancement of technical indicators in a trading strategy.
- To compare the performance of individual machine learning models against ensemble machine learning approaches for stock price prediction.
- To assess the real-world viability and benchmark conventional statistical methods with the proposed ensemble machine learning approach through backtesting and real-time trading simulations.

## üìå Project Motivation
Traditional technical trading strategies, such as those based on MACD or Zero-Lag MACD, often generate false signals due to market noise and lagging indicators.

By integrating machine learning predictions‚Äîespecially ensemble models that combine the strengths of multiple algorithms, we can filter out less reliable signals and improve overall trading performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Fetches historical stock data (hourly/daily) using `yfinance`
- Preprocessing and feature engineering

### 2. **Model Training**
- Trains individual models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LSTM
  - GRU
- Builds ensemble combinations using **simple averaging**

### 3. **Model Selection**
- Evaluates models on:
  - RMSE
  - MSE
  - MAE
  - MAPE
  - R¬≤ Score
  - CV
- Selects best performing model/ensemble per stock and interval

### 4. **Prediction-Enhanced Trading**
- Integrates predictions with Zero-Lag MACD
- Only executes trades if predicted direction confirms MACD signal

### 5. **Parameter Optimization**
- Uses `Optuna` to tune MACD parameters per strategy

### 6. **Backtesting & Evaluation**
- Runs full backtests with:
  - Equity curve visualization
  - Trade logs
  - Performance metrics

### 7. **Real-Time Evaluation**
- Evaluates constructed trading strategies and model predictions on live or streaming market data.
- Monitors performance and adapts strategies in real time for practical deployment.

## üìà Zero-Lag MACD Strategy Enhancement

### üîπ Classic Approach
- Trades based solely on MACD/Zero-Lag MACD crossovers

### üîπ AI-Enhanced Approach
- Executes trade **only if**:
  - Technical signal (MACD crossover) **and**
  - **Model prediction** confirms direction  
  *(e.g., only BUY if MACD crosses up **and** predicted price > current)*

### ‚úÖ Result:
- Fewer false signals  
- Improved **risk-adjusted returns**

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### 1. Classic Backtesting (No Machine Learning)

**Use:**
- `app.py`
- `parameter_optimization.py`
- `stock_analysis.py`

These scripts/notebooks allow you to run and optimize conventional MACD/Zero-Lag MACD strategies on any stock and timeframe for backtesting, enabling evaluation of the trading strategies' ROI. They also include parameter optimization features to maximize ROI.

---

### 2. Machine Learning-Enhanced Backtesting

**Use:**
- `ai_app.py`
- `ai_parameter_optimization.py`
- `ai_stock_analysis.py`
- `model_loader.py`

These scripts/notebooks let you:
- Use the deployed individual and ensemble machine learning models.
- Integrate predictions into conventional MACD/Zero-Lag MACD trading strategies to evaluate novel machine learning‚Äìenhanced Zero-Lag MACD strategies.
- Optimize parameters and backtest the enhanced strategies.
