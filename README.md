# Stock Price Prediction and Zero-Lag MACD Enhancement Using Ensemble Methods

# Stock Price Prediction & Zero-Lag MACD Trading Strategy Enhancement with Ensemble Machine Learning

## Overview
This project investigates how ensemble machine learning models using simple averaging can improve the accuracy and generalizability of stock price predictions. These enhanced predictions are then integrated into trading strategies based on the Zero-Lag MACD technical indicator. 
The ultimate goal is to filter trading signals by forecasting one-step-ahead stock prices, enabling more effective buy and sell decisions in real-world trading scenarios.

By combining robust predictive models with technical analysis, this system aims to:
- To propose an ensemble machine learning approach for stock price prediction through the enhancement of technical indicators in a trading strategy.
- To compare the performance of individual machine learning models against ensemble machine learning approaches for stock price prediction.
- To assess the real-world viability and benchmark conventional statistical methods with the proposed ensemble machine learning approach through backtesting and real-time trading simulations.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Motivation
Traditional technical trading strategies, such as those based on MACD or Zero-Lag MACD, often generate false signals due to market noise and lagging indicators.

By integrating machine learning predictionsâ€”especially ensemble models that combine the strengths of multiple algorithms, we can filter out less reliable signals and improve overall trading performance.
